		<h1>Where The Wild Things Are</h1>
		<h4>By Maurice Sendak</h4>
		<p>The night wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind<br />
		and another<br />
		his mother called him “WILD THING!”<br />
		and Max said “I’LL EAT YOU UP!”<br />
		so he was sent to bed without eating anything.<br />
		That very night in Max’s room a forest grew<br />
		and grewand<br />
		grew until his ceiling hung with vines<br />
		and the walls became the world all around<br />
		and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max<br />
		and he sailed off through night and day<br />
		and in and out of weeks<br />
		and almost over a year<br />
		to where the wild things are.<br />
		And when he came to the place where the wild things are<br />
		they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth<br />
		and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws<br />
		till Max said “BE STILL!”<br />
		and tamed with the magic trick<br />
		of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once<br />
		and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all<br />
		and made him king of all wild things.<br />
		“And now,” cried Max, “let the wild rumpus start!”<br />
		“Now stop!” Max said and sent the wild things off to bed without their supper.<br />
		And Max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where<br />
		someone loved him best of all.<br />
		Then all around from far away across the world<br />
		he smelled good things to eat<br />
		so he gave up being king of where the wild things are.<br />
		But the wild things cried, “Oh please don’t gowe’ll<br />
		eat you up-we love you so!”<br />
		And Max said, “No!”<br />
		The wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth<br />
		and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws<br />
		but Max stepped into his private boat and waved good-bye<br />
		and sailed back over a year<br />
		and in and out of weeks<br />
		and through a day<br />
		and into the night of his very own room<br />
		where he found his supper waiting for him<br />
		and it was still hot.
